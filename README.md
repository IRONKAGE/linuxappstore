# Linux App Store
Is a universal app store for Linux.

### The Problem
Currently each one of these universal formats has their own repository.
* Flatpak has [FlatHub](https://flathub.org/home)
* Snap has [SnapCraft](https://snapcraft.io/store)
* AppImage has [AppImageHub](https://appimage.github.io/apps/)

### Goal
* Browse and install Flatpaks, Snaps, and AppImages without going to these individual websites. 
* Modern, fast and user-friendly
* No command-line
